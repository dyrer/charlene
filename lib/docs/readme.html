     		<h2>Version 2.0 (Requires WP 3.9+)</h2>
     		<p><em>The Charlene Theme V2.0 has been entirely reworked from top to bottom, do not expect to upgrade from an older and outdated version of this theme.</em></p>
               <p>With that note of caution out of the way, I can say that the overall theme design remains largely entact so with a few adjustments you should be able to retain the same old theme design you've also enjoyed with the Charlene theme.</p>
     	
     		<h2>Stripped Down Options</h2>
               <p>If you used the older version of this theme you might be sad to find out that there are almost no options baked into this version of the theme.</p>

               <p>This time around it's all about keeping it simple and easier to maintain. Activate the theme, (maybe) change a few colors, add your favorite plugins for SEO, optimization, and security&hellip; then get to writing.</p>

               <b>The Good News</b>
               <p>You have a few smart customization options through the powerful theme customizer. You can:</p>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Change the background color.</li>
                         <li>Change the link color, which is about all you need to do to change the color scheme.</li>
                         <li>Change the link hover color.</li>
                    </ul>
               
               <p>Plus, you'll still be able to add an intro title and opening paragraph on your home page. <em>See widget areas.</em></p>

     			
     
     		<h2>Other useful things to note</h2>
     			<h3>Widget areas:</h3>
     				<ul>
                              <li><strong>Site Intro</strong> The above mentioned intro title and opening paragraph.</li>
     					<li><strong>Sidebar Main</strong> Main sidebar widget area.</li>
     					<li><strong>After Post</strong> Widget ready area for after post plugins and functions that are packaged with widgets. Would be useful for recent posts or perhaps a text area that links to your available Rss subscriptions.</li>
     				</ul>

                    <h3>Post Formats</h3>
                    <p>Post formats aside, image, video, audio, quote, link, and gallery are supported. Nothing fancy but templates can be overriden or modified.</p>

                    <h3>Page Template</h3>
                    <p>A single full-width page template, might be neat to use the grid shortcode there.</p>

                    <h3>A few simple shortcodes:</h3>
                         <ul>
                              <li><code>[introp]Your Content[/introp]</code> An introductory/lead paragraph with a larger font size. Can be used in posts and pages.</li>
                              <li>
                                   <p><code>[charlene_column size="#" position="#"]Your Content[/charlene_column]</code> A simple shortcode for displaying your post or page content in grid format using a 6 column grid. Size sets the width of the column and position sets the left margin. See grids col_# and push_# in style.css. Must be wrapped in <code>[charlene_row]</code> for proper clearing.</p>
                                   <p>For example a 50/50 grid: </p>
<pre>
[charlene_row]
     [charlene_column size="3"]Content[/charlene_column]
     [charlene_column size="3" position="3"]Content[/charlene_column]
[/charlene_row]
</pre>
                              </li>
                         </ul>
     				
     				
     			<h3>Current State of Support</h3>
     				<p>For right now, you're welcome to report bugs and other issues <a href="https://github.com/jeremyjaymes/charlene">on Github</a></p>
     				
     			<h3>Growing Documentation</h3>
     				<p>This will act as the documentation for now and a theme demo will still live at <a href="http://papertreedesign.com/themes/">Papertree Themes</a></p>
     				
     			<h3>History</h3>
     				<p>The original Charlene Theme (V1 and below) was based on a theme I had created for a personal site and then reworked to take advantage of a custom framework I was using for development at the time (2008ish). While it never gained the popularity of some of the more well known themes it was downloaded over 5K times, a number I could be proud of.</p>

                         <p>Version 2.0 is what I'd call a maturing view of WordPress theme development. It's built with a singular purpose in mind and only includes what is necessary to acheive that purpose while remaining flexible enough that you can extend it.</p>
